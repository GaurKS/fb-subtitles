00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,159
how can you add captions like the ones

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,919
that you see below this video first of

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,680
all let me tell you why you need

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
captions in your videos let's take

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
instagram for example when you scroll

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,800
down your news feed most of the videos

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,960
that you will see they're muted and many

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,719
times you are in situations where you

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,640
can't turn on your audio you can just

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,880
watch it without listening to the video

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
and this happens more than you think

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
so if you add captions there someone can

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
watch it your video without listening to

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
it and understanding what you're talking

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,240
about so what is this tool that i use to

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,238
create automated captions below my

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,960
videos this tool is called autocad it's

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
a really smart app on your phone because

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
i automatically understand what you're

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800
saying and even in my case with my not

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
perfect english autocad can understand

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,000
what i'm saying and you can tweak little

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
mistakes that could be here and there

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,480
don't forget to highlight the keywords

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
in what you say because this will make

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
your message even more powerful
